# rdf-examples

Different examples using modules which use [RDFJS interfaces](https://github.com/rdfjs/representation-task-force/). Have a look at the examples or consult the [documentation repository](https://github.com/rdf-ext/documentation/) if you need a general introduction to the stack.

If you are looking for a specific example, please file an issue in this repository. Pull requests with additional examples are also very welcome.

# How to run

## Run in command line with Node.js

Most examples require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Once node.js is installed, you can run:

```shell
npm install
node --use-strict dataset-to-stream.js
node --use-strict fetch-dbpedia.js
#Â etc
```

## Run in the browser

Some examples can be run in the web browser. Please have a look at the [rdf-ext documentation](https://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-ext#browser) about how to generate the necessary files.
